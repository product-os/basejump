        Upon receiving a pull request comment that begins with "/rebase",

        the bot will:


        1. React to the comment with an "eyes" emoji to indicate start of rebase

        2. Check if the rebase is required by comparing commits, and bail

        early with "rocket" emoji if branch is up-to-date with base

        3. Rebase using cherry-pick method, as there's no API endpoint

        for a direct rebase

        4. After rebase, react with "rocket" emoji to indicate rebase success
          * If error during rebase, react with a "confused" emoji to the comment
          * If error is a code conflict that's resolveable by the user, comment
            on the PR indicating that the user should resolve the conflict manually.
          * If error is of another type, log it
