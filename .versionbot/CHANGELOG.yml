    - subject: Abort if feature branch HEAD sha has changed
      hash: 84e5381b5e16e0d27e3f5fc3bcd8dce56a2ef3aa
      body: |
        This can occur if there was a feature branch code change
        since the rebase has started. Aborting in this case will
        prevent code change loss.

      body: >
        Upon receiving a pull request comment that begins with "/rebase",

        the bot will:


        1. React to the comment with an "eyes" emoji to indicate start of rebase

        2. Check if the rebase is required by comparing commits, and bail

        early with "rocket" emoji if branch is up-to-date with base

        3. Rebase using cherry-pick method, as there's no API endpoint

        for a direct rebase

        4. After rebase, react with "rocket" emoji to indicate rebase success
          * If error during rebase, react with a "confused" emoji to the comment
          * If error is a code conflict that's resolveable by the user, comment
            on the PR indicating that the user should resolve the conflict manually.
          * If error is of another type, log it
