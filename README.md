# Basejump

Basejump is a GitHub App that automates the rebasing of pull requests on-demand using local git operations.

## Overview

Basejump monitors pull request comments on your repositories. When a comment starting with `/rebase` is posted on a pull request, Basejump clones the repository locally and performs a native git rebase operation.

## How It Works

### Triggering a Rebase

To trigger a rebase, simply comment on a pull request with:

```
/rebase
```

### Process Flow

1. **Comment Detection**: Basejump listens for new issue comments and begins the rebase process when a comment starts with `/rebase` on a pull request.

2. **Initial Feedback**: An eyes reaction (ðŸ‘€) is added to the comment to indicate the request was received and is removed once the process completes.

3. **Rebase Necessity Check**: Basejump checks if rebasing is necessary by comparing the PR branch with its base branch. If the PR branch is already up-to-date, it adds a confused reaction (ðŸ˜•) and exits.

4. **Local Git Rebase**: If rebasing is needed, Basejump:
   - Clones the repository to a temporary directory
   - Checks out the feature branch
   - Performs a native `git rebase` operation
   - Force-pushes the rebased branch using `--force-with-lease` for safety
   - Cleans up the temporary directory

5. **Result Notification**: Upon completion, Basejump adds:
   - A rocket reaction (ðŸš€) for successful rebases
   - A confused reaction (ðŸ˜•) for failures
   - An explanatory comment for code conflicts that require manual resolution

## Implementation Details

- **Framework**: Built as a GitHub App using the [Probot](https://probot.github.io/) framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Git Operations**: Uses [simple-git](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js) library for native git operations
- **Safety**: Uses `--force-with-lease` to prevent overwriting concurrent changes

### Key Features

- **Native Git Behavior**: Follows standard git rebase behavior including:
  - Dropping merge commits
  - Skipping commits already cherry-picked to the base branch
  - Preserving intentionally empty commits (`--allow-empty`)
- **Conflict Detection**: Gracefully aborts and reports merge conflicts with commit SHA references
- **Concurrent Change Protection**: Gracefully aborts if remote branch is updated during rebase

## Setup

### Development

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Start the bot after setting WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL in .env
npm start
```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

- `APP_ID`: Your GitHub App ID
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your GitHub App private key (PEM format)
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Your GitHub App webhook secret (optional)

### Docker

```sh
# 1. Build container
docker build -t basejump .

# 2. Run container with environment variables
docker run -e APP_ID=<app-id> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> basejump
```

## Development

### Testing

```sh
# Run tests
npm test

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```
